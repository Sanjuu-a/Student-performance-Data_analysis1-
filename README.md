This project is the first task of my Data Science internship. The objective is to understand and implement the fundamental steps involved in data analysis.
By working through this task, I aim to:

* Master the data analysis workflow: From data loading to cleaning, exploration, and answering analytical questions.
* Organize code effectively: Emphasizing clean, well-documented, and modular code to ensure readability and maintainability.
* Develop foundational skills: Gaining hands-on experience in working with datasets using Python libraries like pandas and numpy.
